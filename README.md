### Server
The server application consists of two main user windows:

#### Starting the server
To start the server, specify the IP address and port.
For the correct operation of the application, you must also configure the path to the database once.

 - RUN  - starts the server
 - Server status - displays basic server information like port and launch time
 - STOP - stops the server

> User list window

After the user registers on the server in the **Users** tab, a record with its data will appear. In order to edit user's data or delete it, it is necessary to click on the record corresponding to the given user. 
User passwords are encrypted by default.

All files uploaded by users are stored in the working directory of the server application. Directory names correspond to user names.
##
### Client
